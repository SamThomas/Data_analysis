### What is JFreeChart?

JFreeChart is Java chart library that makes it easy for developers to display professional quality charts in their applications. JFreeChart's extensive feature set includes:

* a consistent and well-documented API, supporting a wide range of chart types
* a flexible design that is easy to extend, and targets both server-side and client-side applications
support for many output types, including Swing components, image files (including PNG and JPEG), and vector graphics file formats (including PDF, EPS and SVG);
* JFreeChart is "open source" or, more specifically, free software. 

It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL), which permits use in proprietary applications.

### The Model-View-Controler software architecture pattern

Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the representation of information from the user's interaction with it. The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view. The central ideas behind MVC are code reusability and separation of concerns.
